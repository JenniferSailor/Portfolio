# Portfolio

WELCOME! I am still under construction, but feel free to look around :smile:

**About Me:**
With a passion for data-driven insights and problem-solving, I bring a blend of academic rigor and real-world experience to the field of data science. My Master's degree in Applied Statistics and Bachelor's degree in Data Science, coupled with two and a half years of experience, give me a strong background in data analysis, machine learning, and project management. 
Throughout my career, I've thrived in team-oriented environments, leveraging my communication and leadership abilities to cultivate a successful team. My time in Milwaukee was instrumental in honing my skills and furthering my education. Now, back in Kansas City, I am excited to contribute to the local data community and tackle new challenges.
